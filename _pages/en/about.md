<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student (in progress) in Electrical Engineering at Chongqing University. Previously, I was a Master's student in Electronic Information at Shanghai Dianji University, and I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Anhui Xinhua University. My research interests focus on large language models, reinforcement learning, and integrated energy systems, with 7+ published/accepted papers.

Research interests:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Integrated Energy Systems
